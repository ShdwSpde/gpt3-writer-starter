# Project Plant
### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

For this project, I began with the starter template for the [build your own AI writing assistant w/ GPT-3](https://buildspace.so/builds/ai-writer) project.

Based upon my prior experience in rooftop farming and community gardening, I always wanted to further my knowledge of plants. I wanted to be able to instantly come up with designs based upon hearing whatever city my friend or client was in, but let's be honest, I will probably never attain all that data myself. But an ai api might..

Using the openAI api, users will be able to input a city and then retrieve a recommended planting matrix for that city composed of mostly native perennial plants

The amount of tokens(characters) and prompt can still be changed and refined as needed by making minor alterations to the code
