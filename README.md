# Project Plant
### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

For this project, I began with the starter template for the [build your own AI writing assistant w/ GPT-3](https://buildspace.so/builds/ai-writer) project.

Using the openAI api, users will be able to input a city and then retrieve a recommended planting matrix for that city composed of mostly native perennial plants

The amount of tokens(characters) and prompt can still be changed and refined as needed by making minor alterations to the code
